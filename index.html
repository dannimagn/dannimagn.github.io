    <div class="introText">
        Hi, my name is Daníel Magnús Bergmann Ásgeirsson. Thank you for
        taking a look at my online "resumé" so to speak. A small introduction
        to who I am. I am a mixed Bahamian-Icelander born in the Bahamas, raised there
        aswell as in Iceland and I am now living in Cologne, Germany. I currently work
        as an electrician at the local rail company KVB (Kölner Verkehrs-Betrieb) where I inspect
        everything and anything that has to do with normal building electricity (230/400V). Links to my
        certifications will be here on the website.
        <br>
        <br>
        I am also, in my free time, studying, practicing and playing with IT. Notably, web development,
        Linux server management, bash and python scripting and networking technology. I currently follow
        along to the Odin Project, the CompTIA courses from Professor Messer and all the documentation
        I can get my hands on.
        <br>
        <br>
        When I'm not inspecting electrical systems or typing away at a keyboard. I play music.
        I studied Rhythmic Jazz Guitar in Iceland for four years and I still play avidly, although
        I somehow managed to add four other instruments to my repetoire. I sometimes make soundscapes,
        sometimes beats, sometimes songs. If I'm not doing any of the aformentioned activities then I
        am probably at the climbing gym, walking the dog, or even just at home relaxing.
