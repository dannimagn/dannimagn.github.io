            My current job. I work as an inspector for the 200+ stops and mobile devices of the KVB. We test and inspect according to VDE and DGUV 3, interpret the measurement results, and document everything in great detail so that our maintenance team can repair the electrical systems correctly and bring them up to standard.

We undergo a special certification process, which includes seminars on PLC machines and an exam at Mebedo, to qualify us for this task. Our electrical systems vary greatly in terms of age and type, which means that we have a good understanding of the various electrical systems, from low voltage to high voltage. This knowledge is crucial for the measurement process so that we do not destroy very expensive and important electrical components that are critical to the proper functioning of the electrical system when performing measurements such as insulation resistance measurements. Whenever possible, I try to develop tools that make our work easier. For example, the department now uses a simple form for material lists written in HTML, CSS, and JS.

            At this point in my career I was just getting started as an electrician on the way to gather
            a very broad experience from an Icelandic company that is well known for being the "Knowledge Center"
            of electrical in Iceland.

During the first six months, I was responsible for manufacturing high-voltage connections, maintaining substations, and occasionally working on overhead lines. After that, I moved to the production department, where I mainly worked in a switch cabinet workshop manufacturing various switchboards (control, distribution, and normal house switchboards) with a specialization in switch cabinets, and sometimes worked in the transformer workshop with high-voltage transformers. Recently, I have taken on more responsibility by managing orders in the workshop. As far as the switch cabinets are concerned, everything was built from scratch. We received a drawing, which we went through, ordered the material, and built everything from scratch. We usually started with a base plate, measured everything, attached DIN rails, channels, materials, and made all the necessary holes in the cabinet. The process also included quality control, where we checked the switchboard and made sure all connections were correct. We also made changes to the Control elements, if something didn't make sense, whether it was adding a few terminal blocks or completely changing a specific control element because it was drawn incorrectly.        </div>
